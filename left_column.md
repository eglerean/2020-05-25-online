### May 25-27 and June 2-4, 9:00-12:15 CEST

**We are full!  We will try to make more spaces available by live
streaming.  Helpers can still register, see below.  People who are
part of a team but didn't have time to register along with others,
please contact us by email (below).**  This is a developing situation
(2020-05-13), please check back for more information.

target="_blank">We are full, see below</a>

Please see information at right for registration options: learner or
helper, and individual or as a team.

Because of our Nordic funding, priority is for Nordic participants.
This is the first Mega-CodeRefinery, so we reserve the right to make
changes.  **We are getting many registrations, please help us find
helpers.**  Everyone gets added to a waitlist initially, and we
approve people as we get space.  Check back for updates.

Helpers may still register <a href="https://indico.neic.no/event/141/registrations/66/">here</a>.

### Live streaming

We will try to live stream the course so that others, who did not have
time to register, will be able to follow along.  You will not have the
full experience, and there will be breaks while people go to the
breakout rooms and do exercises, but you should get some of the
experience.  We also recommend you join the livestream as teams with a
helper - this will help you learn more.  Check back for more
information, including set-up instructions.


### Course goals and format

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for version control in modern research software development. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.  We don't teach programming, but we teach the tools you need
to use programming well.

This is an informal and interactive online event with type-along type
of presentations, live coding, and demos. Short tutorials alternate
with practical exercises.

We might live stream or record (part of ) the workshop to reach an
even wider audience.  In this case, privacy is our first concern and
*only* the instructor's video will be published, and *breakout rooms
for exercises are completely private*.  More details will come later.


### Software requirements

You need to install some software *before* CodeRefinery ([why we ask
you to do
this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).
Please do this - *and check it* - in advance, otherwise you'll start off
behind.

Note that, e.g., a working Python executable on your laptop is not sufficient -
a version greater than 3.4 is strongly recommended and a number of extra
packages need to be installed as detailed on the Python installation
page.  **You also need to check your git configuration.**  **If you
have an institutional laptop with limited rights, start in advance
and/or ask for help to translate these instructions to work on your system.**

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/), including
  some configuration
- [(optional) Visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
- [Python](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/python/)
- [Jupyter and JupyterLab](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/jupyter)
- [Snakemake](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/snakemake)

**You should either a) drop by one of our verification sessions in
advance, or b) verify with your team's helper before the workshop.**


### Schedule

The schedule includes frequent breaks.  All times are in Central
European Summer Time.  [Convert 9:00 CEST to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Stockholm/2020-05-25/09:00/CodeRefinery%20online#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NvZGVyZWZpbmVyeS5naXRodWIuaW8vMjAyMC0wNS0yNS1vbmxpbmUvIn0=).
