### Who the course is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

If yes, then this course is for you.  This is not designed for
"professional code developers" or computer scientists.

If you develop research code and you know all the tools
already, join us as a helper! It's fun, and you always learn
something new about a subject by teaching it.


### Mega-CodeRefinery?

Welcome to the *first* online mega-CodeRefinery.  This is "mega"
because in the past we have always been limited by physical space or
number of helpers.  *We are now taking direct action to reach as many
people as possible, but this also means we are trying something new.*
We are introducing the concept of **teams** to "bring your own breakout
rooms" to accept as many people as possible.


### How to join

We are normally limited by number of helpers, thus:

- Anyone may register as a learner, we will try to take as many as we can.
- Or you can register as a helper.  If you are somewhat comfortable
  with these tools, you can be a helper! (see below)
- Register as a team, one helper and 4-6 learners.
  - We will accept all complete teams
  - This is a great opportunity to bring your friends and colleagues
    and prepare for the future together.
  - Decide some team name, and when registering, everone enter this
    same name so that we can link you together.
  - During the exercise sessions in breakout rooms, the helper has
    primary responsibility for their group's hands-on exercises.
    Still, instructors drop by to check and help
    as needed, so don't worry if you don't know everything.

If you've been to a CodeRefinery before and have used git some after
that, you are definitely capable of being a helper.  If you routinely
use git and know Python somewhat well, you are also very qualified to
be a helper.


### What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or
the Linux/Unix terminal shell.  We assume that you are familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research.  We try to keep the course as
language-independent as possible but we will show some basic code examples in
Python.



### Prerequisites

- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit
  text files in the terminal.
  [This Linux shell crash course](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell.html)
  ([video](https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI))
  contains the essentials.
- Basics in one or more programming languages.
- You will need to bring a laptop.
- You need to install some software. Please follow links in the schedule.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. We will start from
  the basics anyway, but please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.

### FAQ

* **If the workshop is streamed/published, will I be visible?**
  Privacy and internal safety is our first concern.  Only instructors
  video will be published.  If you use voice to questions in the main room,
  that might be published.  The most common way to ask questions is
  written, and anyone can feel comfortable using this.  Breakout
  rooms, where all of the hands-on work and most discussion happens,
  is always private and unrecorded.

* **I can't register/didn't make it past the waiting list, and I would
  like to follow the streams myself.**  We don't yet know if we will
  do this or what the format will be.  Please check back for further
  information.  Note, we highly recommend registering as a team if
  possible, you will get much more out of the workshop if you are a
  part of it.
